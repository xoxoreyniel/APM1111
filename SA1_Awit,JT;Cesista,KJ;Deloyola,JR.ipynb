Fifty male and 50 female students were selected from Midwestern University and the number of hours per week spent talking on their cell phones determined. The results in hours are shown in Table 10.6. It is desired to test $H_0 : \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 $ versus $H_1 : \\mu_1 \\neq \\mu_2$ based on these samples.\n",
